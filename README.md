# PostocSalaries

This repository contains the code for the analysis on postdoc salary data performed for the paper: *Assessing the Landscape of U.S. Postdoctoral Salaries*.

• Preprocessing of the raw salary data is in the Jupyter notebook _Pre-processing.ipynb_ run on Python version 3.5.2. The package `pandas` needs to be installed for the code to run.

To protect the identity and sensitive information of the postdocs, the raw salary table, containing postoc salaries, names and affiliations is not posted here, but description of the fields can be found in the Jypyter notebook. The table without postdoc names can be found at www.futureofresearch.org.

• The analysis of the preprocessed data is in the file _Paper.R_ using R version 3.4.3.
